# The Tournament Maker

This is a front-end web development project built by John Clary. Using this website, users can create and progress through their own custom tournament brackets. 

## Purpose

The goal for this project was to create a working front-end web app using React. I began this project after completing the "Learn React" course on Codecademy, to serve as my first web development project using React.

## Technologies Used

JavaScript's React library was used for this project as well as HTML and CSS.
